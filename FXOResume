            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have a robust background in Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Privileged Account Management (PAM) functions, with over 14 years of hands-on technical experience in provisioning, deprovisioning, certification and role-based access control. My experience includes supporting Beyondtrust and CyberArk PAM products, coordinating user account provisioning, and ensuring compliance with IAM principles. Over these same 14 years I gained experience working alongside Audit (Internal & External) and Risk teams, where I conducted risk and vulnerability assessments, identified security deviations, and recommended solutions. My work in cybersecurity implementation has given me a solid understanding of IAM services offered by cloud service providers such as AWS Identity Services and Azure AD (now Entra). I am an organized problem solver with solid written and verbal communication skills, adept at understanding technical details and documenting assessments and analyses. My primary IAM and PAM experience has been developed while working in the Financial Services industry, with my primary focus on IAM and PAM processes and operations. I am familiar with KPI/KRI metrics and reporting, and I have prior experience with application integrations involving authentication and authorization services such as SAML, SSO, and MFA. My technical toolkit includes SailPoint, CyberArk, Ping, Delinea, and Active Directory administration, including monitoring, troubleshooting, and Group Policy Management.</p>
